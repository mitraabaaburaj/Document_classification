 Project Overview

This project implements a Document Classification System that automatically classifies text into predefined categories using classical Machine Learning techniques.

The system converts text into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization and then classifies it using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. It also provides a confidence score indicating prediction certainty.

 Objective

To build a lightweight, efficient document classification system that:

runs locally or online

uses classical ML algorithms (no LLMs)

provides probability confidence

handles real-world text data

 Dataset

The model was trained using the 20 Newsgroups Dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Dataset Characteristics

~20,000 documents

20 categories

Real-world text data

 Models Compared

Three classical machine learning models were evaluated:

Model	Role
SVM	Final selected model
Logistic Regression	Comparison model
Naive Bayes	Baseline model
 Why SVM Was Selected

SVM achieved the best performance because:

Handles high-dimensional data well

Works efficiently on sparse text features

Finds optimal decision boundary

Produces strong generalization

 Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Accuracy Formula:

Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
 Confidence Score

The system outputs a confidence score representing prediction certainty.

Confidence Score = Highest Predicted Probability

SVM normally produces decision scores, so probability calibration was applied using:

CalibratedClassifierCV
